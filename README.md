## Hi there 👋

I’m an **intermediate full-stack dev** messing around with  
**JS, React, Node, Express, TS, MySQL**.  
Sometimes I cheat on them with **C++** or **Python** 🤓.  

💥 I’m pretty good at breaking my university practical codes…  

### 🌱 Right now I’m  
- Building small projects with React + Node  
- Trying to make TypeScript my friend  
- Practicing problem solving (and collecting bugs 🐛)  

### ✨ Fun facts  
- Debugging takes 90% of my time (and I still miss a semicolon).  
- Coffee ☕ is my co-developer.  
- If it works on my machine → it’s officially “done”.  
- I break code on purpose just to see how bad it can get 😂.
