## Hi there 👋

I’m a **full-stack dev in progress**  messing around with  
**JS, React, Node, Express, TS, MySQL**.  
  
I’m pretty good at breaking my university practical codes…  

### Right now I’m  
- Building small projects with React + Node  
- Trying to make TypeScript my friend  
- Practicing problem solving (and collecting bugs 🐛)  

### Fun facts  
  - Coffee is my co-developer.  
- If it works on my machine → it’s officially “done”.
